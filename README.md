#### Zixin: 
- paper: **Variational Model Perturbation for Source-Free Domain Adaptation**
- link: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10378](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10378)
- progress: (1). ran the poly-loss adaptation w/o freeze encoder but performance is not good. (2). decide to adjust rl to larger one and change the schedular
